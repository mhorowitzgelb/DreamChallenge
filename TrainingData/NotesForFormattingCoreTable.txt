Notes for editing core table. 
Replace all missing values with ?
For numerical values should hopefully have a . for missing values. (Make sure to do a control find for whole row or else you'll replace decimal numbers)
For region MISSING should be replaced with ?
Remove Smoke frequency and smoke status they just fucking suck.
Be sure to change AGGEGRP for peop >=85 value just to 85 so can be numeric
